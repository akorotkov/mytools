# The workflow is:
# bash li0.sh -- load with PK but no secondaries
# bash lix.sh -- short load, then create 3 secondary indexes
# bash li1.sh -- load with PK and secondary indexes 
# bash r.sh -- read+write with rate limited writer

The read+write step can be repeated many times but the output filenames might be clobbered.
